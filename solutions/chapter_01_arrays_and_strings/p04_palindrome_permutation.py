Chapter 1, Problem 4 - Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is
a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of
letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
